Wallgen
=======

Generate background wallpapers.
All image output will be in [.ppm format (P6)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format).

Usage: ` ./program 1920 1080 > wallpaper.ppm`

Where 1920 and 1080 can be replaced with the dimensions you which the generated image to have.
You can use imagemagic to convert the `.ppm` image into a format which might be more suitable for a desktop image.

All generators can be executed with width and height startup parameters.
But some programs have optional parameters.
Try executing a generator without any parameters and it will print parameter usage documentation.

Generators
----------

![w0_colorcircle](samples/w0_colorcircle.jpg)
![w1_stripes](samples/w1_stripes.jpg)
![w2_blocks](samples/w2_blocks.jpg)

Altering image parameters
-------------------------
Apart from changing startup parameters extensive alterations can be done be altering the defines in each of the generators.
The defines in the head of the .c files can be adjusted to get the right effect that you are looking for.

Preview with fehview.sh
-----------------------
A fast way to preview the images is to use the script supplied `fehview.sh`.
This script requires the program feh to be installed.
In debian based distros you can install feh with apt: `apt-get install feh`.
To use the script just run it with one of the programs as a parameter:

`./fehview.sh w1_stripes`
